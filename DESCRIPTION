Description: savvySh is an R package that implements a suite of shrinkage estimators for multivariate
 linear regression. It is motivated by Stein's paradox, which shows that introducing a small bias can
 reduce variance and improve the overall mean squared error compared to the ordinary least squares (OLS)
 estimator. The package provides four shrinkage methods that aim to improve prediction accuracy and
 estimation stability without requiring cross-validation or extensive tuning (with the exception of
 Shrinkage Ridge Regression, where the shrinkage parameter is chosen by minimizing mean squared error).
 It is especially suited for high-dimensional settings or cases with near multicollinearity, and empirical
 studies indicate that at least one estimator performs as well as or better than OLS.
